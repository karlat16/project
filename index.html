   <div class="titulo1"><h1>80's times</h1></div>
    <p>The fashion of the 2000s, also known as Y2K, appeared with the new millennium and was influenced by technology, pop culture, and media like MTV. People saw the future as something modern and bold, and this was reflected in their style.

Makeup was shiny, with glossy lips and bright skin, inspired by pop celebrities. Fashion included low-rise jeans, crop tops, denim, oversized clothes, and big accessories, mainly coming from the United States. Sportswear also became part of everyday outfits, not only for exercise but for daily life.

Overall, 2000s fashion expressed freedom, confidence, and the desire to stand out.</p>

<p>The style of the 1980s was a very strong and eye-catching way of expression. People dressed like that because they wanted to <br> **stand out, feel free, and show their personality without fear**. After more serious times, the 80s brought ideas of **excess, <br> rebellion, and fun**, and this was clearly shown in fashion. Bright colors, shoulder pads, oversized clothes, and exaggerated accessories <br> represented **confidence, power, and the desire to be seen**. Music, movies, and pop culture also had a big influence, since artists, bands, <br> and films set trends and showed that fashion could be a way to say *“this is who I am”* without using words.
