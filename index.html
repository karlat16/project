   <div class="titulo1"><h1>80's times</h1></div>
    <p id="clas">The fashion of the 2000s, also known as Y2K, appeared with the new millennium and was influenced by technology, pop culture, and media like MTV. People saw the future as something modern and bold, and this was reflected in their style.

Makeup was shiny, with glossy lips and bright skin, inspired by pop celebrities. Fashion included low-rise jeans, crop tops, denim, oversized clothes, and big accessories, mainly coming from the United States. Sportswear also became part of everyday outfits, not only for exercise but for daily life.

Overall, 2000s fashion expressed freedom, confidence, and the desire to stand out.</p>
